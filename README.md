===============================

GOAL OF THE GAME:
Eileen the cat girl doesn't have a problem crossing the road. She's in it to win it. Score as many points as you can by picking up gem stones that appear along Bug Crossing Road, but be careful, these bugs don't seem to give any regard for cat-girl life and they will run her over if she get's in their way. 

CONTROLS:
Use the up, down, left, and right keys on the keyboard to move Eileen around the board.

PICK UPS:
Gems - these are the name of the game for Eileen. Pick these up to score points. Blue gems are worth three, Green are worth two and Orange are only worth one. 

Star Power - give eileen a power up and she will be invincible for a few seconds. Any bugs that run into her while she is indestructable are worth one point. SWEET!

ENEMIES:
Bugs barrel down the road like they are late for a JayZ concert. Watch out for the super fast ones by using Eileen's cat sense that will let her know when a particularly fast one is coming!
